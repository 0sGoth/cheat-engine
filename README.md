# Cheat Engine Scripts, Tutorials, Tools, Etc.

This is my personal repository of all things Cheat Engine! Eventually, it'll fill out as I make more of my private work public.

## Lua Scripts:

1. **PNG Extractor**: Attempts to find and extract .PNG images from a process you've opened with Cheat Engine.
2. **Exponentiation and Nan Filter**: Removes exponentiated (e.g. 3.136598246E-32) and nan (not a number) results from found results list. Handy for weeding out values that could cause crashes when attempting to mass-change or mass-lock values. ***(WARNING: EXTREMELY SLOW! NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USE WITH MORE THAN ~5000-10000 RESULTS.)***
3. **Remove Values with Decimal Points**: Removes results from the found results list that contain a decimal point. Handy for filtering values that aren't perfectly rounded floats/doubles. ***(WARNING: EXTREMELY SLOW! NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USE WITH MORE THAN ~20000 RESULTS.)***

## Cheat Tables (CTs):

**NOTE: These tables are NOT maintained, so don't worry about opening an issue. I do a tutorial or an initial hack of a game, then I move on. The point of the tutorial videos is to demonstrate how to update tables yourself if they don't work with later revisions/updates of a game. I unfortunately don't have the time to keep up with every hack in every game I make a table for!**

1. **Mega Man 11 - No Collision and Infinite Jump**: This CT contains the cheats I created via Cheat Engine in [this Mega Man 11 video tutorial](https://youtu.be/rqD45b0oCJc).
2. **Borderlands 3 Cheats**: This CT contains various cheats I've created for BL3 tutorial videos, as well as just for fun.
3. **The Outer Worlds Cheats**: I made a handful of videos showing how to hack The Outer Worlds, which is what this table is from.
4. **Dragon Quest XI Flycam**: This is the CT I used/created in [my 3-video tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VTASBy-2Xc&t=3292s) showing how to hack 3D game cameras to create a custom flycam.
5. **Streets of Rage 4 Photo Mode**: This is the CT used/created in [my SoR4 tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHK07roS1Bw&t=3013s) showing how to create a photo mode from scratch in a 2D game.
