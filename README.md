# Cheat Engine Scripts, Tutorials, Tools, Etc.

This is my personal repository of all things Cheat Engine! Eventually, it'll fill out as I make more of my private work public.

## Lua Scripts:

1. **PNG Extractor**: Attempts to find and extract .PNG images from a process you've opened with Cheat Engine.
2. **Exponentiation and Nan Filter**: Removes exponentiated (e.g. 3.136598246E-32) and nan (not a number) results from found results list. Handy for weeding out values that could cause crashes when attempting to mass-change or mass-lock values. ***(WARNING: EXTREMELY SLOW! NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USE WITH MORE THAN ~5000-10000 RESULTS.)***
3. **Remove Values with Decimal Points**: Removes results from the found results list that contain a decimal point. Handy for filtering values that aren't perfectly rounded floats/doubles. ***(WARNING: EXTREMELY SLOW! NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USE WITH MORE THAN ~20000 RESULTS.)***

## Cheat Tables (CTs):

1. **Mega Man 11 - No Collision and Infinite Jump**: This CT contains the cheats I created via Cheat Engine in [this Mega Man 11 video tutorial](https://youtu.be/rqD45b0oCJc).
